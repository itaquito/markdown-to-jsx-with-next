# markdown-to-jsx with Next.js

## The problem

Have you ever wanted to use the rich features `next/link` and `next/image` provide, such as image optimization and client-side transition between pages, with markdown? Well, I actually wanted to do the same.

## What is this?

Hello! This a really simple example that shows how you can use `next/link` and `next/image` in combination with `markdown-to-jsx` to solve this problem.

Hope you like it!
